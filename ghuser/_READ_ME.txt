NOTE: These are the actual .ghuser component files that Rhino/Grasshopper will use. You just need to copy these into your Grasshopper 'User Objects' folder and they should all show up next time you restart Rhino.

The easiest way to locate the 'User Objects' folder is to open Grasshopper, go to 'File / Special Folders...' and like 'User Objects Folder'.

Simply copy all of these .ghuser files into that folder. 

Note: if you like, you can put all of these files into a subfolder as well (ie: ../UserObjects/LBT2PH/...) and that should also work. That will help you keep your UserObjects folder tidy.
